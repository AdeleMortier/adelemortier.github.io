\footnotetext{This Chapter includes theoretical points already made in \textcitetoappear{HenotMortier2024c} and \textcitetoappear{HenotMortier2025b}. I would like to thank the audiences and/or reviewers of the Harvard Language \& Cognition Talk Series, the 2024 HeimFest at MIT, the 2024 Amsterdam Colloquium and SALT35, in particular Jonathan Bobaljik, Ivano Ciardelli, Alexandre Cremers, Kate Davidson, Lisa Hofmann, Manfred Krifka, Jesse Snedecker, Benjamin Spector, for questions, datapoints and suggestions regarding earlier iterations of these reflections. I also thank my colleagues Omri Doron, Nina Haslinger, and Jad Wehbe for helpful discussions.}
Lastly, we will introduce  and analyze scalar Hurford Conditionals, and argue that they may receive a treatment that is independent of exhaustification, and in fact solely based on \textsc{Incremental Q-Relevance}, as defined in Chapter \ref{chap:hurford-sentences}.
